    <h3>
        Formation and early years
    </h3>
    <p>
        BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping. The lineup was finalized with Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook in 2012 when Jin, the oldest member of the group, was twenty-years-old. Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain attention for their presence on various social media websites, as well as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud.
